 🏗️ Project: MetaWay (The System Anatomy)

**Tagline:** "The Digital Twin of the BahyWay Ecosystem."
**Status:** Planned (Post-v1.0)
**License:** Enterprise / Premium Only

### 🎯 Core Concept
A specialized Knowledge Graph layer that visualizes the **Architecture** rather than the **Data**. It answers the question: *"How is this system built and running right now?"*

### 🧩 Key Components

**1. The Code Crawler (Static Analysis)**
*   Scans `src` folder (C#, Python, SQL, Akkadian).
*   Reads "Passport Headers" to link Callers to Callees.
*   **Result:** Nodes representing Actors, Services, and DTOs.

**2. The Infra Scanner (Dynamic Analysis)**
*   Queries Docker/Kubernetes API.
*   Maps running containers to the Code Nodes.
*   **Result:** Visualizes which code is running on which hardware (NAS vs Cloud).

**3. The Governance Overlay**
*   Visualizes Policy Rules (e.g., "GDPR Strictness").
*   Highlights components that are non-compliant or missing headers.

### 💰 Business Model
*   **Locked** for Standard Users.
*   **Unlocked** via License Key (`LicenseService`).
*   **Value:** Essential for Compliance Audits (Banking/Gov) and Root Cause Analysis.
